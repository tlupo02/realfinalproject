		<p class="pimgLeft"><img src=../images/album1.jpg></p>

		<div class="ptxtRight">
			<h7>Overview</h7>
			<p>Yours Truly is the debut studio album by American singer Ariana Grande.</p>
			<p>Musically, Yours Truly is primarily a pop and R&B record, while incorporating mid-'90s hip hop, '50s piano pop, and doo-wop music within its beats and productions. Featured collaborators include Big Sean, Mika and Mac Miller, in addition to The Wanted's Nathan Sykes, who features on the song "Almost Is Never Enough", which was also included on The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones soundtrack (2013). Yours Truly debuted atop the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 138,000 copies in its opening week; it was eventually certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold 615,000 copies in the United States as of June 2020.</p>
			
			<h7>Background</h7>
			<p>Work on Yours Truly began in August 2010 while Grande was in the process of filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had 20 songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to 13. On December 12, 2011, Grande released "Put Your Hearts Up" as the intended first single for the album. The song was a bubblegum pop song, released with the intention of catering to Grande's core audience, which at that time was almost entirely made up by young children who knew her from Victorious.</p>
			<p>The album was originally announced as Daydreamin', named after one of the songs included in the album and was slated for an early September release, but Grande decided to later rename it to Yours Truly, because the album felt like a love letter.</p>
			<p>In 2013, Grande met up with her label and expressed dissatisfaction with the direction the album was taking. In several interviews during 2013, she admitted to having completely disliked her debut single, "Put Your Hearts Up", and not having an interest in pursuing music of that genre. She expressed a desire to make the type of music she grew up listening to, which was, "urban pop, 90s music."</p>

		
			<h7>Chart Performance and Awards</h7>
			<p>On September 4, 2013, Billboard reported that Yours Truly would most likely sell between 110,000 and 120,000 copies in its first week in the United States by the end of September 11, 2013. Yours Truly officially debuted at the top of the US Billboard 200 chart, with 138,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming Grande's first number-one album as a solo artist.</p>

			<p>This made Grande the fifteenth female artist ever and the first female artist to have their first album debut atop of the charts since January 2010, when Kesha's Animal opened at number one.</p>

			<p>In 2013, Yours Truly was ranked as the 106th most popular album of the year on the Billboard 200. It then went on to become the 68th most popular album on that chart, the following year.</p>

			<p>With the release of Yours Truly, it cemented herself as an upcoming popstar. She earned accolades such as New Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards.</p>

		<p class="pimgRight"><img src=../images/album2.jpg></p>

		<div class="ptxtLeft">
			<h7>Overview</h7>
			<p>My Everything is the second studio album by American singer Ariana Grande, released on August 25, 2014 by Republic Records. Grande desired for My Everything to sound as "an evolution" from her debut album, Yours Truly (2013); it explores more mature themes and music genres. In the album's production, Grande worked with a host of producers and co-writers – including Max Martin, Shellback, Benny Blanco, Ryan Tedder, Darkchild, Ilya Salmanzadeh, Zedd, and David Guetta, to name a few. On the standard edition, the record features guest appearances from Iggy Azalea, Zedd, Big Sean, Cashmere Cat, Childish Gambino, the Weeknd and ASAP Ferg, alongside Jessie J and Nicki Minaj on the deluxe edition.</p>

			<p>Primarily a pop and R&B record, My Everything expands on the 1990s retro-R&B style of its predecessor, while also approaching new genres such as EDM, electropop and dance-pop. Upon its release, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, selling 169,000 copies in its first week, thus marking Grande's second consecutive chart-topper in the US. </p>

			<h7>Background and recording</h7>
			<p>Grande's debut studio album Yours Truly was released on September 3, 2013, and was met with critical acclaim. Later that month, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Grande stated that she had begun writing and working on her second studio album and had already completed two songs. Recording sessions began in October 2013 with Grande working with previous producers from her debut album Harmony Samuels and Tommy Brown. Grande was initially aiming at releasing the album around February 2014.</p>
			<p>She finished working on the album in late May 2014. On June 28, Grande confirmed the title of the album to be My Everything and the release date to be August 25, 2014. The photos for the packaging in the album were taken on May 27, 2014. Grande stated that she chose the cover artwork because she felt that "each song is so strongly themed that I just wanted to have a very simple overall cover. So that within each song we could create more visual themes."</p>

			<h7>Chart Performance and Awards</h7>
			<p>On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to ratings and reviews from mainstream critics, My Everything received an average of 64, based on 19 reviews, which the cite defines as "generally favorable reviews".</p>
			<p>On August 27, Billboard reported that My Everything would sell over 160,000 copies in its first week. My Everything officially debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 169,000 copies in its first week. By doing so, Grande attained her second consecutive number-one album in the country, becoming the first female artist to have her first two albums debut at number one since Scottish singer Susan Boyle did it with I Dreamed a Dream (2009) and The Gift (2010).</p>
			<p>This album ended up earning Ariana her first Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p>

The album features guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy Gray and Future. Dangerous Woman is primarily a pop and R&B record, with influences of dance-pop, disco, house, trap, and reggae genres. Lyrically, the album explores themes of love, destructive relationships and rebelliousness. Grande, Max Martin, and Savan Kotecha were the album's executive producers. The album was originally titled Moonlight, named after the album's opening track, with the song "Focus", released as a single in 2015, being the intended lead single. However, the album's name was later changed to Dangerous Woman, with "Focus" being removed from the album's standard track listing, though it remained as a bonus track on the Japanese deluxe edition of the album.</p>

			<h7>Background and recording</h7>
			<p>On August 25, 2014, Grande released her second studio album My Everything, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and it sold 169,000 copies in its first week. Months after its release, Grande revealed that her third studio album could be titled Moonlight making reference to the title in her Twitter account. Following the rumors about the album's release date, Grande officially announced the lead single of Moonlight called "Focus" during her September 15, 2015 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. "Focus" was released digitally on October 30, 2015. The song debuted and peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 113,000 copies in its first week in the United States. In interview to U.K station KISS the singer said the song was something of an outlier on the album. "That's why I put 'Focus' first, because it's the only one that sort of sounds like that." She also stated the station: "I'm excited for the next couple of months to not only finish [Moonlight] but to have actual undivided time where I can really just focus on the music.""
			</p>

			<p>However, after months of speculation, while discussing the album's direction in interview with Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Grande revealed that she was no longer sure of the name, and that she might re-title the album after another song on the album. "A really long time ago I was convinced that it was going to be called Moonlight because its one of my favorite songs that we did for the album," the singer explained. "And now, as we're wrapping things up, of course I've been writing and singing, we're at the final stretch... now there's this other song that has thrown me for a whirlwind and I love it so much, it's changed everything." She announced the new title of the album, Dangerous Woman, on February 22, 2016, through her Snapchat and Twitter accounts. The following day, she posted a photo on Instagram with a caption quoting Egyptian feminist writer Nawal El Saadawi's 1975 novel, Woman at Point Zero as follows: "They said, 'You are a savage and dangerous woman.' I am speaking the truth. And the truth is savage and dangerous".

		<p class="pimgLeft"><img src=../images/album5.jpg></p>

		<div class="ptxtRight">
			<h7>Overview</h7>
			<p>Thank U, Next (stylized in all lowercase along with its songs) is the fifth studio album by American singer Ariana Grande, released on February 8, 2019, by Republic Records. It was released six months after her fourth studio album Sweetener (2018), created in the midst of Grande's personal struggles, including the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and her breakup with then-fiancé Pete Davidson. Grande began working on the album in October 2018, enlisting writers and producers such as Tommy Brown, Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh and Andrew "Pop" Wansel. With the album, Grande began to gain more creative control over her music and distanced herself from a traditional album release cycle compared to her previous albums. Musically, Thank U, Next is a pop, R&B, and trap album, taking influences from hip hop.</p>
			<p>Thank U, Next was preceded by two singles, the title track and "7 Rings", with both debuting atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Grande's first and second number one singles in the United States, respectively. "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" became the third single on the day of the album release, peaking at number two on the Hot 100. All its 12 tracks entered the Billboard Hot 100, with the singles, occupying the top three spots, making Grande the first solo artist to achieve it. The album peaked at the top spot in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the US. It broke multiple streaming records upon release, including the records for the largest streaming week for a pop album and for a female album in the United States with 307 million on-demand streams. It was certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for earning two million album-equivalent units in the US. On the US Billboard 200 Year-End chart for 2019, Thank U, Next became the second best-performing album in the country. Globally, it was the eighth best-selling album of 2019 and fourth best-selling album by a female artist.</p>

			<h7>Background</h7>
			<p>In August 2018, singer Ariana Grande's Sweetener was released to critical acclaim, her best received album to that point. Grande began contemplating her follow-up as she prepared touring. Republic Records sought to bolster Sweetener's global rollout by releasing "Breathin" as the third single, but the label abruptly postponed their promotional endeavors when Grande's old friend and ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died from an accidental drug overdose in early September. Grande then took a brief hiatus from the media to record new material. By the following month, the still reticent singer expressed renewed interest in touring, one supporting both Sweetener and her forthcoming project, and she soon announced the initial leg of her Sweetener World Tour. At the same time, Grande ended her five month engagement with comedian Pete Davidson.</p>
			<p>The fallout of Miller's death influenced Grande's choice of collaborators. She assembled Thank U, Next's production team from producers and songwriters with shared rapport to better cope with the trauma. Longtime collaborators Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Tommy Brown composed most of the tracks and shared responsibilities with Charles Anderson, Social House's Michael Foster, among others, in the formation of the music.</p>


			<h7>Chart Performance and Awards</h7>
			<p>Upon release, Thank U, Next received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 86 based on 24 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim"; it is the highest Metascore for any of Grande's albums.</p>

			<p>Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated that Thank U, Next is "one of the year's best pop albums so far, even in a 2019 that's already turning out to be a great one for new music. Thank U, Next makes you suspect that the best Ariana is yet to come."</p>

			<p>The album landed in the top ten of many year and decade-end lists. Claiming the top spot of many year end lists.</p>

			<p>The album landed Ariana many nominations at award shows, but did not end up winning any major awards. However, the album broke many Guiness World Records for it's music video and audio being able to generate millions of streams and views.</p>

			<p>On April 19, 2020, it was first reported that Ariana Grande was working on new music. She also declared in May 2020 that she had recorded a song with Doja Cat earlier that year. In the same interview, however, Grande stated that she would not release an album during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. On October 14, 2020, Grande announced on social media that her upcoming sixth studio album would be released the same month. Three days later, she posted a slow-motion video in which she types out the word "positions" on a keyboard. That same day, Grande's official website launched two countdowns counting down to October 23, 2020 and October 30, 2020.
